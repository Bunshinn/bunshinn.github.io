
OneR Algorithm
==========================

OneR(*One Rule*) Algorithm , is a simple algorithm that simply predicts the class of a sample by finding the most frequent class for the feature values. OneR indicating we only use a single rule for this classification by choosing the feature with the best performance. 

该算法遍历每一个特征的每一个值, 对于该值, 统计样本中每一类别的该值的个数, 记下最频繁的类的个数值, 以及预测错误率.
